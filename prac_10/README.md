# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
A little bit off.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
Gradually I understood the question and the time i would take to write the code depending on the
requirement of the question.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
It helped me form procrastinating and actually finish the code on time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
All the Code are flawed, and we can always improve.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
I learn how to improve my own code and that people skip error handling cases more often 
than they realize.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1
rather than just breaking the quit option you can add finishing lines like total trip cost
'''
while True:
        print(menu)
        choice = input(">>> ").lower()

        if choice == "q":
            break
        elif choice == "c":
'''

### Explanation

he just quit the program without showing any follow up sentence

### Good Code Review 2
"""
else:
            print("Invalid option")

@tobden9 tobden9 yesterday
your code can have more error handeling cases

@tobden9	Reply...
        print(f"Bill to date: ${total_bill:.2f}")
"""

### Explanation

There can be more error handeling cases to make the code clean

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would coding session in class rather than theory class.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
Create usable and understandable classes.
